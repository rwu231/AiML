I have implemented a text recognition app by using android machine learning(firebase ml kit) which allow
the user to take an image by using a phone camera and the system can detect text in mage by using a firebase
machine learning kit.


How this can help in human-AI interaction? The user can extract text from the image in real-time without needing to input it into the device. This can help in many real-life scenarios, for example when travelling abroad and the language barrier. If a user encounters a sign that does not have English writing, then they can use a
text recognition app to translate it into English.



To design the frontend part of the app: Image, text and button code is added. Functionality is included from
the android doc guide such as the camera function.
